Berger-2009,"FUNCTION: Key regulator of entry into cell division. Acts as a transcription repressor of E2F target genes, whose activity is required for progress from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle. Hyperphosphorylation by CDKA-1 prevents the binding to E2F transcription factors, allowing G1 to S phase transition to operate (PubMed:18064404, PubMed:21444209). Forms a stable complex with E2FA that functions in maintaining cell proliferation through repression of cell differentiation (PubMed:22307083). Plays a central role in the mechanism controlling meristem cell differentiation, cell fate establishment and cell fate maintenance during organogenesis and gametogenesis (PubMed:16377572, PubMed:16815954, PubMed:19359496, PubMed:20525851, PubMed:20585548, PubMed:20683442, PubMed:22595674, PubMed:24285791, PubMed:25303364).

Also involved in controlling asymmetric divisions of stem cells in different stem cell niches (PubMed:22921914, PubMed:23104828, PubMed:24302889). Acts as negative regulator of cell proliferation during leaf and gametophytes development (PubMed:15201912, PubMed:16361519, PubMed:18976913). At later stages of development, restricts the progression through additional endocycles (PubMed:16361519). In the leaf, plays a role in the control of the mesophyll differentiation (PubMed:24118480). Another role is its implication in the regulation of imprinted genes. Acts together with MSI1 to repress the expression of MET1 during gametogenesis. This in turn activates expression of the imprinted genes FIS2 and FWA (PubMed:18700816). Regulates many genes of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) (PubMed:18976913, PubMed:19704913, PubMed:20585548). Plays an important role in meiosis affecting different aspects of this complex process (PubMed:21217641). Functions as a positive regulator of the developmental switch from embryonic heterotrophic growth to autotrophic growth (PubMed:21693514).
